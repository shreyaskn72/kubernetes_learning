# This is the example of a ClusterIP Service in Kubernetes


apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-clusterip-service
spec:
    type: ClusterIP
    selector:
        app: my-app
    ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 8080


# In this example:
# - A Service named "my-clusterip-service" is created.
# - The Service type is set to "ClusterIP", which means it is only accessible within the cluster.
# - The Service selects Pods with the label "app: my-app".
# - The Service exposes port 80 and forwards traffic to port 8080 on the selected Pods.
# To apply this configuration, save it to a file named "ClusterIP_Service.yaml" and run:
# kubectl apply -f ClusterIP_Service.yaml
# You can then access the Service from within the cluster using the ClusterIP address assigned to it.
# You can check the Service details using:
# kubectl get service my-clusterip-service
# kubectl describe service my-clusterip-service
# Note: ClusterIP Services are not accessible from outside the cluster. To expose a Service externally, consider using NodePort or LoadBalancer types.
    clusterIP: None  # Optional: Set to None for headless service (no ClusterIP assigned)
